# CHDK Scripts

These are scripts for helping with the use of the [Canon Hacking Development Kit](http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK)

* Sync CHDK scripts to SD card - Uses rsync to sync up a folder on the hard drive with a folder on the SD card. Minimal error checking at this point, making sure that there is an SD card with the right format mounted and the two directories exist. First sync is from drive to card.
