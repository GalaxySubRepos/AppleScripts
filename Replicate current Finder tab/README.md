# Replicate Current Finder Tab

As the title suggests, this script will create a new tab in the current Finder window, having the same target as the frontmost tab. The script is very basic and assumes that it's being run from the Finder, so there's no checking that the Finder is running.

I activate it via a keyboard shortcut that only works in the Finder, so that's why it's so simple.
