# Useful stuff

Like it sounds.

- Snippets contains useful bits to use in longer scripts.
- "Toggle Bluetooth" turns Bluetooth on and off with a notification.
- "Move app windows" moves the windows of a few apps when there's more than one display in use, since they can't remember how to do this themselves.
